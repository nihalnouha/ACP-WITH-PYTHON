# PCA WITH PYTHON
This project consists of an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. This implementation provides a simple and efficient interface for performing PCA on data sets, allowing for the analysis and visualization of relationships between variables and the reduction of data dimensionality while preserving as much important information as possible.

# Steps:
1. Data Loading: Load your data into a pandas DataFrame if it is stored in a CSV file, Excel, or another data source.

2. Data Standardization: It is generally recommended to standardize your data before applying PCA so that each variable has comparable variance. You can use StandardScaler from scikit-learn for this purpose.

3. PCA Object Instantiation: Create a PCA object using the PCA class from scikit-learn. Specify the number of principal components you want to retain.

4. Model Fitting: Fit the PCA object to your standardized data using the fit() method.

5. Data Transformation: Transform your data using the transform() method to obtain the principal components.

6. Results Analysis: Analyze the principal components to understand the variance explained by each component, visualize the data in a reduced-dimensional space, and identify underlying structures or trends.
